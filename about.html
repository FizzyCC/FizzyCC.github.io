            <h1>What is Collapsing Craters?</h1>
            <p>
                Collapsing Craters is a multiplayer minigame created in Minecraft Education Edition by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-Xo9YwMBSVpMODkhqtrOug">Fizzy Friday</a> with help from <a target="_blank" href="">AGrizzly1</a> during the early versions.
                <br>
                <br>
                The gameplay is centered around creepers spawning and exploding the arena forcing 
                players to use blocks in their inventory to build up to high ground and use abilities
                to give themselves an advanatage resulting in intense fights for the center. 
                Every 90 - 120 seconds, the zone closes in giving the players less room to build as 
                well as allowing the players to fall off the map.
                <br>
                <br>
                As well as the default gameplay, there is also an interactive story that is 
                continued every new update with new challenges to complete.

            <h1>What is the History of Collapsing Craters?</h1>
            <p>
                Collapsing Craters originally started in 2021 as "Lava Game" as a spoof of Squid Game and involved players being surrounded by lava and mobs from someone in creative mode
                which resulted in having to do difficult jumps to gain access to more land and outrun the player in creative.
            </p>
            <h1>How do Zones Work?</h1>
            <p>
                The map starts out 15x15 blocks wide and 16 blocks deep and slowly shrinks and moves around after each zone.
                This adds pressure to the game and makes draws much less common as players aren't able to camp in a single spot.
                You are able to look upwards to see what blocks have been removed, what blocks will be removed, 
                and which blocks will be removed after the next zone making it easier to create strategies and game plans.
            </p>
            <p>Refer to the table below for the amount of time before each zone as well as the size of the zone.</p>

            <h1>How does the Ranking Work?</h1>
            <p>
                The formula for the number of points recieved in a game is 
                <code>p = 4 - n</code> where <code>p</code> is the number of points and 
                <code>n</code> is the placement in that round.
            </p>
            <p>Refer to the table below for the amount of points recieved per placement.</p>
